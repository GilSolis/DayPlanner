# Day Planner

Creation of a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of their standard work day. This is a useful application for someone who does not need to keep track of what they have done over a longer period of time but does not want to waste paper for each day's to do list.

## Concepts Used For This Project

* Capturing information entered by user using click events, and storing the gathered values in `localStorage`.

* Communicating with [Moment.js] to display current date and compare to current time.
